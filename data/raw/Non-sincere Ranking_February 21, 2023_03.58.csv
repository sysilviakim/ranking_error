You are invited to participate in a research study by Silvia Kim (Department of Government, American University, Washington, D.C.) and Yuki Atsusaka (Department of Government, Dartmouth College, Hanover, NH). This study aims to understand people's interactions with ranking survey questions on political and non-political issues and their opinions about such topics.


Should you decide to participate in this research study, you will be asked to indicate your consent below. This study consists of a survey that will be administered to individual participants online. Participation in this study will require approximately 12 minutes of your time. The investigators do not perceive more than minimal risks from your involvement in this study. This research will contribute to understanding how people engage with ranking survey questions as well as understanding how people think about complex political and non-political issues.

The investigator will not have access to any information that can personally identify specific research participants. All presentations of the data will discuss aggregate results or generalizations about the responses of large subgroups. The researcher retains the right to use, and publish from, these data for the foreseeable future and to store these data for future use.

Your participation is entirely voluntary. You are free to choose not to participate. Should you decide to participate, you can withdraw at any time without negative consequences of any kind. You may also refuse to answer any particular question without consequences.
